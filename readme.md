# Rust Nix Template

This is a starter pack for Nix friendly Rust project ecosystem provided to you by [Bleur Stack] developers.
The project uses rust toolchain derived from nixpkgs to fetch necessary tools and then compile your binary.

> Please, after bootstrapping, rename / change all `example` or `template` keywords in template files.

## Development

The project has `shell.nix` which has development environment preconfigured already for you. Just open your
terminal and at the root of this project:

```bash
# Open in bash by default
nix develop

# If you want other shell
nix develop -c $SHELL

# After entering Nix development environment,
# inside the env, you can open your editor, so
# your editor will read all $PATH and environmental
# variables, also your terminal inside your editor
# will adopt all variables, so, you can close terminal.

# Neovim
vim .

# VSCode
code .

# Zed Editor
zed .
```

The development environment has whatever you may need already, but feel free to add or remove whatever
inside `shell.nix`.

## Building

Well, there are two ways of building your project. You can either go with classic `cargo build` way, but before that, make sure to enter development environment to have cargo and all rust toolchain available in your PATH, you may do like that:

```bash
# Entering development environment
nix develop -c $SHELL

# Compile the project
cargo build --release
```

Or, you can build your project via nix which will do all the dirty work for you. Just, in your terminal:

```bash
# Build in nix environment
nix build

# Executable binary is available at:
./result/bin/template
```

## FAQ

### Why not use default.nix for devShell?

There's been cases when I wanted to reproduce totally different behaviors in development environment and
production build. This occurs quite a lot lately for some reason and because of that, I tend to keep
both shell.nix and default.nix to don't mix things up.
